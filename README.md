===========
Simulator software for a molecular model of an HIV and T cell interaction

For an overview of this simulator and a list of features, please see `docs/overview.pdf`.

To run this simulator, please refer to `docs/quick-setup-guide.pdf`.

To learn how to use the simulator in detail, please refer to `docs/user-manual.pdf`.

Note that this simulator is no longer being worked on, although the simulator should still be fully functional as long as the right dependencies are installed (see `docs/quick-setup-guide.pdf` for the list of dependencies). Development for this simulator stopped in early 2015 (the commit log is not reflective of such), and will remained stopped for the foreseeable future unless the developers decide to pick up the project again or someone forks the repository. This code has been made public in case it provides a useful starting point for others in modeling HIV and its underlying processes.
