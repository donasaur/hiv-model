This is a process class whose evolve_state method is called
at each timestep.

An instance of MRNAExport is initialized once per Simulation
with the State as input. Only the state 'mRNAs' is modified in
this process.

At each timestep, for an mRNA strand x, for all x, evolve_state reads
the amount of x in the nucleus and cytoplasm and writes back new values
of x in the nucleus and cytoplasm depending on how much of the particular
strand is set to be exported from the nucleus.

All types of:
-multi-spliced mRNAs (17)
-8-Rev-bound single-spliced mRNAs (7)
-8-Rev-bound full-length mRNAs (1)
have a chance to be exported.

Summary of the biology:
This process takes into account the export of mRNA strands from the nucleus to 
the cytoplasm at each timestep.

The HIV mRNA transcript has an RRE (Rev Response Element) located between splice
donor 4 (D4) and splice acceptor 7 (A7). This RRE must bind a threshold number of
Rev molecules to enable mRNA export to the cytoplasm. Multi-spliced mRNA transcripts
have excised this RRE element (D4-A7 splice), and therefore may be exported 
immediatly to the cytoplasm. Multi-spliced mRNAs are therefore called 
"Rev-independent" mRNAS. The full length and single-spliced mRNAs still have 
their RRE elements, and therefore are "Rev-dependent". It is unclear from the 
literature, how many Rev molecules must be bound for export. We know that the
value is >1 and <= the max number of bound Rev. The requirement for Rev
binding essentially poses a delay on certain transcripts getting to the 
cytoplasm. The Rev-independent transcripts start translation before the 
Rev-dependent transcripts.
